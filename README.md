🛡️ Blockchain Security Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my Blockchain Security Engineering Portfolio, where I showcase weekly projects in Smart Contracts, DeFi Security, Exploit Simulation, and High-Assurance Testing with Foundry.
Each project is designed to highlight my progress, security mindset, and deepening expertise in Ethereum protocol engineering. ⚔️

🧠 Skills & Technologies

🔐 Solidity (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, custom primitives)

🧪 Foundry Suite – Forge (tests), Cast (CLI), Anvil (local chain)

🔍 Security Testing – Fuzzing, invariants, fork testing

💸 DeFi Protocol Mechanics – AMMs, flash loans, staking, vaults

🎨 NFT Standards – Metadata, royalties, permit, marketplaces

🧬 DAO Governance – Proposal flow, voting, timelocks

🔄 MEV & DEX Simulation – Sandwich attacks, arbitrage, swap logic

☁️ IPFS/Filecoin – Decentralized storage

🔗 Chainlink Oracles – Price feeds, VRF, automation

📆 Weekly Project Schedule

I commit to uploading 1 new Foundry-based security project every week.

Week	🔨 Project Topic
01	Foundry Basics: Storage, Counter, Events
02	Allowlist Access Control + Custom Errors
03	PiggyBank Vault (Secure Withdrawal Patterns)
04	Fuzzing & Property-Based Testing
05	ERC20 Token + Attack Surface Analysis
06	ERC721 NFT + Permit + Anti-MEV Techniques
07	Flash Loan Simulator (Anvil Fork Testing)
08	Simple AMM + Sandwich Attack Simulation
09	Time-Lock Vault + Invariant Testing
10	DAO Governance System
...	📈 More Projects Coming Soon...
📁 Project Structure

Each project folder follows a consistent structure for clarity and scalability:

/project-name
│── src/            # Solidity smart contracts
│── test/           # Forge unit tests, fuzzing, invariants
│── script/         # Deployment & automation scripts (Forge scripts)
│── foundry.toml    # Compiler settings & remappings
│── README.md       # Project documentation

⚙️ Tools & Frameworks
